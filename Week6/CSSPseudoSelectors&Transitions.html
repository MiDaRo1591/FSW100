<!-- 
For this assignment, conduct the following:

Make 6 small boxes. Each one, when moused over, should change 2 or 3 different properties of the box that was hovered.

Every event should happen on hover, which you can just use the CSS :hover pseudo-selector for. 

You choose which properties change, but try to vary it between each box. Here's a non-exhaustive list of something you could change about each box:

Background color
Border (width, color, style)
Border radius (can target each corner individually if you want)
Box shadow
Height/width
Margin/padding (put some text inside to better see what's happening)
Position
Opacity
Challenge Task (no points deducted for not completing): Learn about the HTML5 <audio> tag and insert some music to play in the background. It's just like you're in the club!
